## Description

Used example 4 from in class tutorial to add 2 new levels, that loads automatically after the
previous level is completed.

---

## Learning Goals

Example 4 Learning Goals:

- Loads JSON levels (preload)
- Builds Level objects
- Creates/positions the Player
- Handles input + level switching

It is intentionally light on "details" because those are moved into:

- Level.js (grid + drawing + tile meaning)
- Player.js (position + movement rules)

Side Quest Learning Goals:

- Generate levels using arrays or JSON data
- Using loops to dynamically place tiles, obstacles or platforms.
